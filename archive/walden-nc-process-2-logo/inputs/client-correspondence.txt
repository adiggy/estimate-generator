Message: Hi! I work at UNC for a research study for prostate cancer survivorship. We are looking to create a study image or logo for our study. Can you help us create a study image and if so, how much would that cost?

For a little background, this is the second wave of the NC ProCESS Study now called “NC ProCESS 2”.  Attached are two images that we used for our first phase of our study that we started over 10 years ago. You could look at these for reference or inspiration. We would like a fresh look. The full name of our study is the “North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effectiveness & Survivorship Study 2” or “NC ProcESS 2”. We would like it that “Carolina Blue” shade or shades. Maybe have the state of NC in the background. We would like the “2” in study name and anacronym to stand out somehow. The ribbon is a good symbol and the state of NC. You have creative freedom. We would like to have this logo as soon as possible. Not sure how long it typically takes you to produce an image.
