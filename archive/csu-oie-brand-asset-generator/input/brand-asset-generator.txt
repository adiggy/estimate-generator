## App summary

This app is a brand-safe ad generator designed to help teams quickly create consistent, on-brand marketing assets without needing design skills. Users drop in basic content like images, headlines, dates, and links, and the app handles layout, styling, sizing, and output so everything aligns with CSU brand standards while still allowing visual variety.

The tool works as a flexible template system rather than a single rigid design. Users can switch between formats, layouts, and photo treatments, reposition and zoom images, and choose brand-approved visual effects. Text automatically reflows based on what’s included, and optional elements like dates and times can be shown or hidden without breaking the layout.

Assets export at the correct resolution for their intended use, whether that’s social media or print. The goal is speed, consistency, and confidence: put in raw content, get a polished, ready-to-use ad.
