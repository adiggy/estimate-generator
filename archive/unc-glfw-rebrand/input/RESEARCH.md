# Global Lead-Free Water Website Rebrand - Research Notes

## Project Overview

- **Client:** Catherine Rierson, Conference & Project Coordinator
- **Company:** UNC Water Institute (part of Gillings School of Global Public Health)
- **Email:** waterinstitute@unc.edu
- **Project Type:** Website rebrand (single-page site, brand compliance)
- **Related Proposal:** 2026-01-23-water-institute-rebrand (main Water Institute site)

## Source Documents Analyzed

This proposal was derived from the main Water Institute rebrand project. The GLFW website hours were originally bundled into that estimate but have been separated for clearer scoping and billing.

### Reference Documents (from parent project)
- UNC Branding Update.pdf - University brand mandate
- Gillings_School_of_Global_Public_Health_Brand_Book.pdf - Brand guidelines
- GLFW website analysis (single-page scrolling site)

## Site Structure

The Global Lead-Free Water website is a single-page scrolling site with the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hero | Main banner with GLFW branding and mission statement |
| Events | Upcoming workshops, conferences, and gatherings |
| Problem Statement | Overview of lead contamination issues |
| Partners | Logos and links to partner organizations |
| FAQ | Frequently asked questions about the initiative |
| Resources | Downloads, links, and educational materials |
| News | Recent updates and announcements |
| CTA | Call-to-action for involvement/contact |

## Scope Decisions

### Included
- Brand audit of single-page site
- Apply UNC brand system (reusing components from Water Institute project)
- Header with UNC toolbar
- Footer with Gillings School signature
- Typography migration to Open Sans
- Argyle graphic elements where appropriate
- Cross-browser testing
- Two revision rounds

### Excluded
- Content creation/copywriting
- New photography
- SEO optimization
- Ongoing maintenance

### Why Separated from Main Project
- Clearer scope definition for each deliverable
- Separate billing if client wants to phase the work
- GLFW has distinct branding needs (different hero, different content)
- Allows main Water Institute site to proceed independently if needed

## Estimation Rationale

### Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

**Brand Audit (1-2 hrs)**
- Single page to review
- Map all brand touchpoints (logo, colors, typography, graphics)
- Document required changes

**Design & Components (2-3 hrs)**
- Adapt header/footer from Water Institute design system
- Adjust for single-page context
- Minimal original design work (leveraging parent project)

**Page Redesign (4-6 hrs)**
- 8 sections to redesign
- ~30-45 min per section average
- Hero section may need extra attention

**Development (3-4 hrs)**
- Implement new design in code
- CSS updates for typography/colors
- Component integration
- Leverage work from main Water Institute project

**QA & Launch (2-3 hrs)**
- Cross-browser testing
- Device testing
- Brand compliance check
- Deploy to production

### Cost Efficiency Note
This estimate assumes the GLFW work happens alongside or immediately after the main Water Institute rebrand. The design system and components created for Water Institute will be reused, significantly reducing effort.

If GLFW were done as a completely standalone project (without the Water Institute work), the estimate would be higher (~18-24 hrs) because all design system work would need to be created from scratch.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Likely same stack as current site (or simple static HTML/CSS)
- No CMS needed (single page, rarely updated)
- Simple hosting requirements

### Integration with Water Institute Project
- Shares brand system (header, footer, typography)
- May share hosting infrastructure
- Updates should be coordinated for brand consistency

## Open Questions / Future Considerations

### Items That May Come Up
- Should GLFW link back to main Water Institute site?
- Any SEO considerations for the standalone domain?
- Will there be a subdomain structure (glfw.waterinstitute.unc.edu)?

### Potential Scope Creep
- Requests to add new sections
- Interactive elements (maps, calculators)
- Multi-language support
- Blog or news feed integration
