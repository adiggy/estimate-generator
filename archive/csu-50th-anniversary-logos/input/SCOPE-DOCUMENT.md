# CSU Cultural Resource Centers — 50th Anniversary Logo Design
## Project Scope Document

**Prepared for:** Chrisana Hughes, Office for Inclusive Excellence, Colorado State University
**Stakeholders:** John Miller IV (B/AACC), Aaron Escobedo Garmon (El Centro)
**Date:** February 2, 2026

### Overview

Both the Black/African American Cultural Center (B/AACC) and El Centro are celebrating their 50th anniversaries in 2026. This project will create distinct anniversary logos for each center, plus a potential joint logo for a shared signature event. These logos are approved by Jared as temporary campaign marks and must align with CSU's Find Your Energy branding guidelines and the Poppins typeface.

The logos will be used across a range of marketing — event flyers, social media, email headers, postcards, a cookbook/lookbook, pins, stickers, Save the Date materials, and fundraising communications — so each logo needs to work at both large (flyer) and small (lapel pin) sizes.

### Deliverable 1: B/AACC 50th Anniversary Logo

**Central Motif — The Sankofa Bird**

The Sankofa is a West African symbol of a bird whose neck curves back toward its body, with an egg held in its mouth. It faces east (head to the right, body to the left). The feet, the direction of the bird, and the egg are the essential elements — everything else can be creatively interpreted.

The Sankofa proverb: *"It is not taboo to go back and fetch that which you have forgotten."*

The bird itself should be the central piece of the logo, with "50th" as a supporting element rather than the dominant feature. John confirmed that for alumni 20+ years out, the Sankofa bird will resonate immediately.

**Tagline / Wordplay**

- "Looking BAACC" — a play on the center's nickname that ties directly to the Sankofa's meaning of looking back to move forward
- The logo should be structured so that the word "BAACC" is highlighted within "Looking BAACC" in the expanded version

**Color Palette**

Drawn from the traditional B/AACC logo (the circular kente-pattern mark): rich reds, greens, oranges, and yellows. Original vector files for these colors do not exist, so we will recreate the kente patterns in Illustrator and extract accurate color values from the existing low-resolution images.

**Additional Inspiration Shared by John**

- Baobab tree (featured in their Black History Month branding — the golden vine/branch motif at the top of their "Woven Roots" flyer)
- Mountain peaks (referencing the Rites of Passage retreat held annually in Estes Park)
- The multicolored Sankofa bird reference — in the original story, she is a multicolored bird, so the patterns/feathers can incorporate different colors representing different cultures of the African diaspora
- Root systems and interconnectedness as a recurring theme

**Key Themes**

- Connecting the past to the present to inform the future
- Each color/feather of the Sankofa represents a different meaning, culture, history
- Memorial, legacy, honoring those who came before
- The logo will also be used on a cookbook/lookbook and many other marketing pieces

**Deliverable Formats**

1. **Badge/icon version** — Circle or compact mark, works at lapel pin size (~1 inch). Minimal text, "50th" prominent, Sankofa bird recognizable at small scale.
2. **Expanded version** — Includes "Looking BAACC" tagline. Suited for flyers, posters, and larger marketing.
3. **Horizontal layout** — For use on the cookbook/lookbook cover and email headers where a wide format is needed.
4. **Stacked layout** — Vertical arrangement for contexts where the circle doesn't fit.

All versions will be primarily full color. The design will be structured so that in a single-color scenario (white on dark or dark on light), the outline still clearly reads as the Sankofa bird.

### Deliverable 2: El Centro 50th Anniversary Logo

**Central Motif — Historical Textiles**

El Centro's identity is rooted in the rich textile traditions of the Latinx/e diaspora. Their existing brand incorporates patterns from five countries — Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama — each representing distinct cultural traditions woven together as one.

Rather than selecting a single image to represent such a diverse community, the textiles themselves are the central image. The concept is one of weaving together — different patterns, different cultures, different histories — into a unified whole.

**Visual References**

- **Historical Textiles document** — The five country-specific patterns that form bands in the El Centro diamond logo
- **Sunburst wall wrap** — The vibrant mural outside El Centro's office, where textile shards refract outward from a central sunburst, representing the coming together of diverse traditions
- **Existing El Centro diamond logo** — The layered diamond mark with concentric textile bands
- The textiles should appear as shards, borders, or interwoven bands — not as a single flat pattern

**Language**

- Spanish is central to this logo: **50 aniversario** (with superscript: **50^o**)
- Possible inclusion of founding year and 2026 (e.g., "1976 - 2026")
- Fonts: Poppins and Bodoni (CSU brand fonts)

**Three Messaging Themes** (these inform the campaign, not necessarily the logo text)

1. **Orgullo** (Pride) — Honoring the past, the accomplishments, the impact
2. **Coming Together** (Presente) — Being present, celebrating in community
3. **Futuro** (Future) — Sustaining the next 50 years, fundraising, continued investment

**Audiences (Threadbearers)**

- Local community
- B/AACC (partner center)
- Alumni and Alumni Association
- Current students (new, returning, Multicultural Greek Council)

**Deliverable Formats**

1. **Badge/icon version** — Compact mark incorporating textile elements. Works at small scale for pins, stickers.
2. **Expanded version** — Includes "50 aniversario" or date range. Suited for flyers, posters, fundraising materials.
3. **Horizontal layout** — For email headers, website banners, postcards.
4. **Stacked layout** — Vertical arrangement.

All versions primarily full color. Structured so outline remains recognizable in single-color use if needed.

### Deliverable 3: Joint Logo (Pending Approval)

**Status:** Chrisana is checking with Kauline on budget and feasibility. This deliverable will only proceed if approved.

**Context**

B/AACC and El Centro are hosting a joint signature event for their shared 50th anniversary — the largest event of the campaign, receiving the most university investment (monetary and labor). Historically, there has been tension between the two offices. The current leadership (John and Aaron) are committed to messaging solidarity and coalition. The joint logo must feel integrated, not like two separate logos placed side by side.

**Creative Direction**

Rather than designing a completely new third logo, the approach would be to artistically merge the two individual logos in a way that visually communicates unity:

- Chrisana's idea: A circle with "50" where the "5" carries El Centro's textile identity and the "0" carries B/AACC's patterns/Sankofa identity
- John's idea: Something that starts as one and ends as the other, with an intentional blending in the middle — patterns from both cultures interwoven
- Aaron's idea: Not two logos bordered together, but something that embodies coalition — perhaps textile shards and Sankofa feathers refracting together
- Shared cultural touchpoint: the Afro-Latine diaspora, hibiscus flower, or another symbol that naturally bridges both communities

**Planned Uses**

- Postcards and Save the Date
- Email headers
- Both centers' websites
- Social media assets
- Fundraising materials

### Deliverable 4: B/AACC Kente Pattern Vector Recreation

The traditional B/AACC kente-cloth patterns from their circular logo do not exist as vector files. As part of this project, these patterns will be recreated in Adobe Illustrator as clean vector artwork, giving John's team scalable, high-resolution assets they can use in future marketing materials at any size — independently of the 50th anniversary logo.

### Logo Usage & Constraints

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Duration** | Temporary campaign marks for the 50th anniversary year (2026). They do not replace the official CSU unit identifiers. |
| **Brand compliance** | Must align with CSU Find Your Energy branding. Jared has approved these as temporary marks. |
| **Typography** | Poppins and Bodoni (CSU brand fonts), used for both B/AACC and El Centro logos. |
| **Color use** | Primarily full color. Designed so the outline is recognizable in single-color applications if needed. |
| **Scalability** | Must work from lapel pin size (~1 inch) up to poster/banner size. |

### Process

**Round 1 — Simple Version First**
Start with the most compact version of each logo (the badge/icon). This forces us to nail the core concept at its simplest before expanding. Initial concepts presented for feedback.

**Round 2 — Refinement**
Based on feedback, refine the chosen direction. Iterate on colors, proportions, and details.

**Round 3 — Layout Expansion**
Once the core design is approved, expand into the additional layouts (horizontal, stacked, expanded with tagline). Deliver final files.

**Joint Logo** (if approved)
Developed after the individual logos are finalized, since it builds on both.
