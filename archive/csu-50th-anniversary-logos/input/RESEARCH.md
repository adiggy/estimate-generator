# CSU 50th Anniversary Logos — Research Notes

## Project Overview
- **Client:** Chrisana Hughes, Office for Inclusive Excellence, Colorado State University
- **Stakeholders:** John Miller IV (B/AACC), Aaron Escobedo Garmon (El Centro)
- **Project type:** Logo design — two 50th anniversary logos + joint event logo + vector pattern recreation
- **Key constraint:** Temporary one-year campaign marks (approved by Jared), must align with CSU Find Your Energy branding
- **Fonts:** Poppins and Bodoni (CSU brand fonts)
- **Note:** "Madone" in the meeting transcript is a transcription error for "Bodoni"

## Source Documents Analyzed

1. **2026-02-02-FULL-meeting-transcript.vtt** — Full 50-minute Zoom meeting transcript (398 entries). Core source for all creative direction, cultural context, and stakeholder preferences.

3. **GMT20260202-170320_Recording.m4a** — Full meeting audio recording (30.8 MB). Could not listen; relied on transcript.
4. **baacc-quote.txt** — The Sankofa proverb: "It is not taboo to go back and fetch that which you have forgotten."
5. **el-centro-details.txt** — El Centro's three messaging themes (Orgullo, Coming Together, Futuro), threadbearer audiences, and Spanish notation for 50th (50º aniversario).

### BAACC Images
6. **A07596AC...jpg** — Traditional B/AACC circular logo with kente-cloth patterns (reds, greens, oranges, yellows). Low resolution — no vector files exist.
7. **958F7822...png** — Traditional Sankofa bird (black/white/maroon). Head faces right, body left, egg in mouth, feet visible.
8. **sankofa-colorful.jpg** — Multicolored Sankofa bird illustration. Demonstrates that the bird can be rendered in many colors per the original story.
9. **7FDB37E7...jpg** — Baobab tree photo. Referenced by John as inspiration (featured in Black History Month branding).
10. **33B77ACE...png** — Black History Month "Real Talk" flyer. Shows current BAACC branding: dark background, gold vine/branch motif (baobab-inspired), Cultural Resource Centers lockup at bottom.
11. **FA7E0B78...jpg** — "Woven Roots" fashion show flyer. Shows the baobab vine motif more prominently, purple brushstroke accent, gold text on dark background.
12. **EAC49771...jpg** — Abstract art with BAACC color palette (red, green, yellow, black). Silhouetted figures. Shows the style of imagery associated with the center.

### El Centro Images
13. **61F46F58...png** — El Centro horizontal logo. Diamond mark with concentric textile bands + "EL CENTRO / COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY" in green.
14. **ED44FB43...png** — Sunburst wall wrap outside El Centro's office. Vibrant composition where textile shards refract outward from a central sunburst. Key inspiration piece for the 50th logo.
15. **Historical Textiles.pdf** (3 pages) — Comprehensive brand document showing:
    - Page 1: Historical textile patterns from Peru (3 variations), Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama. Background text explaining the significance of textiles to the Latinx/e diaspora.
    - Page 2: "Ram Welcome" marketing piece showing El Centro branding in context — "Find Your PODER at CSU" with textile color bands.
    - Page 3: "Adelante con Nuestra Familia" Spanish-language flyer + El Centro infographic with mission, programs, and statistics (established 1976, 4,073 Hispanic students = 14.6% of CSU).

## Scope Decisions

### Included (Option B — "The Sweet Spot")
- B/AACC: Custom stylized Sankofa bird with kente colors, "Looking BAACC" wordplay, 2 layouts (badge + horizontal)
- El Centro: Textile composition using existing pattern assets, sunburst/weaving concept, "50º aniversario", 2 layouts (badge + horizontal)
- Joint logo: Creative merger of the two (pending Kauline's approval)
- Vector recreation of B/AACC kente patterns
- 2 revision rounds per logo

### Excluded
- Full illustration-level detail (feather-by-feather patterning, fully re-illustrated textiles from scratch) — that's Option A territory ($12K-$16K)
- Marketing collateral (postcards, email templates, social media graphics)
- 4 layout variations per logo (reduced to 2 per logo)
- Animation/motion graphics

### Why Option B
These are one-year campaign marks, not permanent brand identities. Option B preserves the cultural depth both centers care about while being realistic about the investment for a temporary mark. The Sankofa bird will still be unmistakable, the textiles will still tell their story. If B/AACC later wants to develop the Sankofa into a permanent mark, this provides a foundation.

## Estimation Rationale

### Phase breakdown:
- **Discovery (5-8 hrs):** Substantial reference material to review — 50-min transcript, 15+ images, textiles PDF, existing branding. Color extraction from low-res BAACC logo. Mood board development for two distinct cultural identities.
- **B/AACC Logo (18-24 hrs):** The Sankofa bird is the most labor-intensive element — even stylized, it's a custom illustration with cultural requirements (direction, feet, egg, neck curve). Integrating kente colors, the "Looking BAACC" wordplay, and producing 2 layouts with 2 revision rounds.
- **El Centro Logo (14-20 hrs):** Slightly less than BAACC because the existing textile assets can be leveraged rather than illustrating from scratch. Still requires creative composition, the shard/sunburst arrangement, Spanish typography, and 2 layouts with 2 revision rounds.
- **Joint Logo (6-10 hrs, optional):** Builds on both individual logos rather than starting from scratch. The split-50 or interlocking concept reduces design time. Pending Kauline's approval.
- **Kente Vector Recreation (4-6 hrs):** Recreating geometric kente patterns in Illustrator from a low-res source. Straightforward but precision-requiring work.
- **Final Delivery (4-6 hrs):** Exporting all formats, color modes, sizes. Organizing the file package.

### Totals
- **Core (without joint logo):** 45-64 hours = $5,400-$7,680
- **With joint logo:** 51-74 hours = $6,120-$8,880
- Rate: $120/hr

## Technical Considerations

- **Sankofa bird direction:** Must face east — head to right, body to left. John confirmed this is culturally significant.
- **Sankofa essential elements:** Feet, neck curve, egg in mouth. Everything else is open to creative interpretation.
- **El Centro Spanish notation:** 50º with superscript "o" — not "th". Aaron emphasized this.
- **CSU brand compliance:** Poppins + Bodoni fonts. Find Your Energy alignment. Temporary marks only — cannot replace unit identifiers.
- **BAACC kente source:** Only low-res circular logo exists. Will need to eyedrop colors and recreate patterns manually in Illustrator.
- **Scalability:** Logos must work from ~1 inch (lapel pin) to poster size. This constrains detail level — another reason Option B's stylized approach is appropriate.

## Open Questions / Future Considerations

- **Joint logo approval:** Pending Kauline's decision on budget and feasibility. Aaron and John are both committed to it, Chrisana is supportive but budget-conscious. It's for one signature joint event but could be used for future collaborative events (Heritage Month, etc.).
- **Historical tension context:** Aaron shared that there has historically been tension between the two offices. Current leadership is committed to healing and coalition. The joint logo design must be sensitive to this — integrated, not bordered/separated.
- **B/AACC long-term use:** John hinted at wanting to use the Sankofa design beyond the 50th — for future marketing with Find Your Energy. This isn't in scope for the current project but could be future work if the unit identifier rules allow it.
- **Marketing collateral:** Aaron mentioned needing postcards, email headers, social media assets, Save the Date materials. These are not included in this logo project but could be a follow-up engagement.
- **Afro-Latine connection:** John suggested a hibiscus flower as a shared cultural touchpoint for the joint logo. Worth exploring in the design phase.
- **Aaron's team input:** Aaron mentioned wanting to check with his team for additional logo preferences. Chrisana gave them a week to send feedback.
