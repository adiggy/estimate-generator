# Email to Chrisana — 50th Anniversary Logos: Options & Next Steps

**Subject:** 50th Anniversary Logos — Scope Options for Your Review

---

Hey Chrisana,

I loved our meeting with John and Aaron — the passion and thoughtfulness they both bring to their centers is awesome, and I'm super excited to work on this. The Sankofa bird, the textiles, the "Looking BAACC" wordplay, the concept of threadbearers — there's so much rich material to work with!

And I want to be transparent about something before we formalize the estimate, because I want to make sure we land on an approach that gives both centers something they're proud of while being realistic about budget and logo usability.

**The tension:**

Both centers shared incredibly detailed, layered visions for their logos — custom-illustrated Sankofa bird with patterned feathers representing different cultures, five countries' worth of historical textiles woven into a compositional piece, multiple layout variations, a potential joint logo, and vector pattern recreation. That level of custom illustration and design is the kind of work that typically goes into a permanent brand identity for an organization that will use it for decades. For logos at that depth, we'd normally be looking at $7,000+ per logo — so north of $14,000 for the pair, before the joint logo.

But these are one-year campaign marks. They're beautiful, meaningful, and important — but they have a built-in expiration date. So I want to make sure we're investing wisely.

Here are three approaches, ranging from the full vision (not likely) to a more budget-conscious route. All of them honor the cultural elements and storytelling that John and Aaron shared — the difference is in how much custom illustration and how many variations we produce.

### Option A: Full Custom — "The Full Vision"
**Estimated range: $12,000 – $16,000**

This is everything both centers described in the meeting, fully realized:

- **B/AACC:** Fully custom-illustrated Sankofa bird with patterned feathers incorporating kente colors/motifs. "Looking BAACC" wordplay integrated. All four layout variations (badge, expanded with tagline, horizontal, stacked).
- **El Centro:** Fully custom textile composition — all five country patterns reimagined and woven into an original design with sunburst/shard motifs. "50 aniversario" with proper Spanish notation. All four layout variations.
- **Joint logo:** A custom-designed merged mark for the signature event.
- **Vector recreation:** B/AACC's kente patterns rebuilt as clean vector files for future marketing use.
- **3 rounds of revisions** per logo.

*Best for:* If the budget is available and the university sees this as a flagship investment in both centers' visibility.

### Option B: Focused Custom — "The Sweet Spot"
**Estimated range: $6,000 – $9,000**

The same cultural depth, but we work smarter about where the custom illustration hours go:

- **B/AACC:** Custom Sankofa bird design — stylized and graphic rather than fully illustrated with intricate feather-by-feather patterning. Still incorporates the kente color palette and reads unmistakably as the Sankofa. "Looking BAACC" wordplay in the expanded version. Two layouts (badge + horizontal).
- **El Centro:** Textile composition that leverages the existing pattern assets creatively — arranged as shards, bands, or a border treatment rather than fully re-illustrated from scratch. Sunburst/weaving concept preserved. "50 aniversario" with proper notation. Two layouts (badge + horizontal).
- **Joint logo:** A creative merger of the two individual logos (e.g., the split-50 concept you suggested, or an interlocking treatment) rather than a third design from scratch.
- **Vector recreation:** B/AACC kente patterns included.
- **2 rounds of revisions** per logo.

*Best for:* Getting logos that are culturally rich and distinct, with enough versatility for the marketing needs, without the full price tag of permanent brand identity work.

### Option C: Anniversary Badge — "Efficient & Impactful"
**Estimated range: $3,000 – $5,000**

One strong, versatile mark per center that captures the essence:

- **B/AACC:** Sankofa silhouette with selective kente color accents (not fully patterned). Bold "50th" treatment. One primary layout with one adaptation (e.g., badge + horizontal).
- **El Centro:** Textile-inspired border or frame treatment around a central "50 aniversario" — using color and pattern references from the existing assets rather than a fully custom composition. One primary layout with one adaptation.
- **Joint logo:** A designed lockup that artistically places the two logos together (not a third design, but a thoughtful pairing).
- **No vector recreation** of kente patterns (just color palette extraction).
- **2 rounds of revisions** per logo.

*Best for:* If budget is the primary constraint. Still culturally grounded and unique — just less elaborate in execution.

### My Recommendation

I'd suggest **Option B**. It lets both John and Aaron see their cultural elements fully represented without the cost of producing what would essentially be permanent brand-identity-level illustration work for a one-year campaign. The Sankofa bird will still be unmistakable, the textiles will still tell their story, and both logos will work beautifully across the marketing materials you described — flyers, email headers, social media, Save the Dates, and the cookbook.

It also keeps the door open: if, down the road, B/AACC decides they want to develop the Sankofa design into a more elaborate permanent mark (which John hinted at), we'd have a strong foundation to build from.

**Next step:** Let me know which option feels right for the budget, and I'll put together the formal estimate and proposal. Happy to hop on a quick call if it's easier to talk through.

Thanks, Chrisana — looking forward to this one.
