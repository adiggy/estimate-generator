Firstly, thank you everyone for your time this morning! It was great to see you all and e-meet you Adrial.

Adrial & Chrisana, after meeting, I have a few more questions:

• I'm not sure if it's necessary because it was never required, but Symposium also allows students to upload a 2-3 minute video along with their poster; then their poster, abstract, and video are all on display to the public. Could students submit more than one item in each form? Could they submit .mp4's and .pptx for the Oral Presentations, or would they need to submit a link to a YouTube video, etc.?

The 2-3 minute video was not required and was not heavily used. It caused some confusion because some students thought the intro video was their presentation.

• Symposium also allows us to download an abstract booklet. Is this something the Air Table Abstract form could do? We'd need it organized by category first (all social science submissions together, all stemm, etc.) and then in alphabetical order by project title. We then display the abstract booklet on the website, so could Air Table create the booklet & display it online?

If we cannot upload the abstract book via air table, having the the website be an option will be fine because most folks looked at the abstract booklet via Symposium…they only use it to upload their poster.

• Lastly, and this can be a project for the future, but Zoë and I started to ask what our connection looks like to the community, and how many families/ friends/ etc. come to MURALS. Could we add a registration form for audience members as well just to see how many people come to MURALS that aren't a part of the event itself?

Great idea…

JoAnn, I know you weren't able to come to the meeting today about moving the MURALS posters on Symposium to the OIE website and I wanted to follow-up with a recap. As I told Adrial and Chrisana, if anyone from the meeting sees anything missing or needs correcting, please do so!

Recap:

• Adrial can set up Air Table (forms) for MURALS Participant Registration, Abstract/ Poster/ Oral Presentation Submissions and these forms can live on a website so students only need to submit materials in one "app"


• The Registration form will be used to collect demographic data of each MURALS participant for Zoë's assessments and also to establish the "Group Names" to be used for the other forms. CSU ID's will be used as unique identifiers for students.


• Students in a group can have any member submit their Abstract, Poster and Oral Presentation, since they will have to select a "Group Name" from a drop-down menu. This will reduce the number of repeat submissions and the confusion with abstracts last year when people from the same group submitted different abstracts for various reasons, or one member submitted the abstract and another submitted the poster, etc.


• We can change things in Air Table so that information changes on the website (like if a student wants to change their project title). We can also control deadlines for submissions. Posters can live on the website for ever so that anyone can access them in the future (especially past participants). These projects can also be made searchable.


• Adrial will look into whether or not people can leave public comments on the posters like they can in Symposium. (Do I remember this correctly? Or did I make this up?)


• Judges for Abstracts & Posters will be assigned similarly to Symposium and Adrial will look into whether or not they can login to only see the projects they've been assigned to make judging easier.


• All of the forms will be connected to spreadsheets, so we can pull data directly and get scores easily.


• If approved by Kauline to move forward (Chrisana will find out next week), Adrial projects that this can be done by December 1st to move forward for MURALS 2025. Therefore, we would not use Symposium.


I know this was a lot of info and I may not be communicating it the best, so please let me know if you'd like to talk this through more 1:1.
