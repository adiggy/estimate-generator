The basic of the app is that they want to be able to have students submit
  their presentations to the tool, then judges can go in and give feedback and ratings for each
  of the submissions, then the winner is declared. The submission might include a PPT
  presentation that would be embedded on the page, a PDF writeup text-based document, and perhaps
  a video embed. Then judging happens anonymously. I'm going off of memory from a conversation that happened a year and half ago, so also be sure to mention that in the estimate that there may be other scope pieces that I'm forgetting.
