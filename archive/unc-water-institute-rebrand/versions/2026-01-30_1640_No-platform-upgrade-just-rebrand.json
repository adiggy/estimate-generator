  "clientCompany": "UNC Water Institute",
  "projectName": "Water Institute Website Rebrand",
  "clientNote": "Note: This is a revised proposal that focuses on rebranding the existing legacy site in place. The previous version included upgrading to a modern headless CMS for easier content editing and faster future development; this version removes that upgrade to reduce scope and cost while still achieving full UNC brand compliance across all pages. The GLFW website rebrand remains a separate proposal.",
  "date": "January 30, 2026",
  "expirationDate": "February 2, 2026",
  "projectDescription": "Rebrand the Water Institute website to comply with UNC's new university-wide brand architecture. This includes retiring the standalone Water Institute logo, implementing the new Gillings School signature system, updating typography to Open Sans, and integrating the UNC website toolbar and argyle graphic elements across all pages. All updates will be made within the existing legacy website (no platform upgrades, migration or CMS restructuring).",
  "estimatedTimeline": "3–4 weeks from kickoff. To meet the February 28, 2026 compliance deadline, we need to begin immediately.",
  "internalNotes": "Revised scope — client said original was too high. Removed headless CMS migration (Supabase + Sanity) and custom dev. Now a Webflow-in-place rebrand. Same 33 static pages + 14 CMS collection templates, but no data migration or platform change. All work done manually in Webflow.",
